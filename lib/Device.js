    This is a generic method to connect any profiles
    the remote device supports that can be connected
    to and have been flagged as auto-connectable on
    our side. If only subset of profiles is already
    connected it will try to connect currently disconnected
    ones.

    If at least one profile was connected successfully this
    method will indicate success.

    For dual-mode devices only one bearer is connected at
    time, the conditions are in the following order:

        1. Connect the disconnected bearer if already
        connected.

        2. Connect first the bonded bearer. If no
        bearers are bonded or both are skip and check
        latest seen bearer.

        3. Connect last seen bearer, in case the
        timestamps are the same BR/EDR takes
        precedence.
